Project Overview
================

mlQuantify is an open-source Python library for quantification, providing robust methods to estimate class prevalence with a practical and intuitive API. The library aims to make quantification algorithms and experimental protocols accessible to both researchers and practitioners in data science.

Most Importantly
================

mlQuantify was **heavily inspired by** `QuaPy <https://github.com/HLT-ISTI/QuaPy>`_, a leading library for quantification in Python, and by `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ for its simple, familiar interface and workflow design.

By combining key architectural elements, quantification strategies, and evaluation protocols from QuaPy with the ease-of-use and consistent patterns found in scikit-learn, mlQuantify offers a unified, modern experience for quantification tasks.

History
=======

mlQuantify was started in 2024 by Luiz Fernando Luth Junior and André Gustavo Maletzke, aiming to address the unique challenges and opportunities in quantification. Recognizing that quantification is a niche yet crucial task in real-world data scenarios, mlQuantify fills an essential gap in the Python machine learning ecosystem.

Governance & Contributors
=========================

mlQuantify is built with a community-driven and transparent development process. All major decisions are discussed openly in the project's issue tracker and forum.
