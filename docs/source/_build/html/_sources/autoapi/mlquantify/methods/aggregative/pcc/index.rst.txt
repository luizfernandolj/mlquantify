.. py:class:: PCC(learner: sklearn.base.BaseEstimator)

   Bases: :py:obj:`mlquantify.base.AggregativeQuantifier`


   Probabilistic Classify and Count. This method
   takes the probabilistic predictions and takes the 
   mean of them for each class.


   .. py:attribute:: learner


   .. py:method:: _fit_method(X, y)

      Abstract fit method that each quantification method must implement.

      Args:
          X (array-like): Training features.
          y (array-like): Training labels.
          learner_fitted (bool): Whether the learner is already fitted.
          cv_folds (int): Number of cross-validation folds.



   .. py:method:: _predict_method(X) -> dict

      Abstract predict method that each quantification method must implement.

      Args:
          X (array-like): Test data to generate class prevalences.

      Returns:
          dict: Dictionary with class:prevalence for each class.
