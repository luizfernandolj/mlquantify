# Cython integration plan for mlquantify

Design document for adding compiled (Cython) acceleration to mlquantify, in the
style of scikit-learn. It defines **where** Cython goes, **what data structures
and algorithms** to use in C for real efficiency, **how to build/ship** it, and
**how to prove** the speedup with benchmarks and parity tests.

> **TL;DR.** mlquantify is already vectorised and delegates the heavy work
> (classifiers, KDE, `cdist`, `np.histogram`) to compiled C. Cython only pays off
> in one place: **Python/numpy per-call overhead inside tight inner loops over
> tiny arrays.** Profiling proves exactly one such hotspot — the histogram
> distribution-matching α-sweep (DyS/HDy/HDx) — plus one conditional candidate,
> batched histograms for wide `HDx`. Everything else stays pure Python.

---

## 1. Philosophy: benchmark-first, not Cython-first

Rules for every candidate:

1. **Profile first.** Only Cythonise code that a profiler shows is hot *and*
   Python-overhead-bound (many calls on small arrays), not work already done in C.
2. **Keep a pure-Python reference.** Every kernel has a Python twin with the same
   signature, used as a correctness oracle and an install-without-compiler fallback.
3. **Prove the delta.** A kernel is not "done" until a committed benchmark shows
   the speedup and a parity test shows identical output.
4. **Small surface area.** A handful of leaf kernels (no Python objects, no I/O),
   not a Cython rewrite of the class hierarchy.

What is **already C** and must not be touched: sklearn classifiers,
`KernelDensity`, `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`, `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`,
`numpy.histogram`'s counting core, BLAS.

---

## 2. Profiling evidence (where the time actually goes)

Measured on this machine (`.venv`, numpy 2.x), representative workloads.

### 2.1 HDy `predict` — the hot loop

20 predicts of 1000 samples, bins swept 10→110 with the grid solver:

```
607,541 function calls in 0.797 s
  ncalls  tottime  function
  22,220   0.151   metrics/_distances.py:hellinger_backend
  44,440   0.131   losses/_distances.py:normalize_distribution   (2x per objective)
  67,500   0.112   numpy.ufunc.reduce
  22,220   0.056   losses/_distances.py:DistanceLoss.__call__
  22,220   0.052   matching/_base.py:_mixture
  22,220   0.041   matching/_histogram.py:objective
```

Per predict ≈ **1,100 objective evaluations** (11 bin sizes × ~100 α-grid), each
doing `2× normalize + 1 mixture + 1 distance` on **8–110-element** vectors. The
cost is numpy *per-call overhead* (`asarray`, ufunc dispatch, `_wrapreduction`),
not arithmetic. **This is the #1 Cython target.**

### 2.2 Representations

```
HistogramRepresentation.transform :  0.07 ms (1 feat) → 1.06 ms (10) → 7.3 ms (100)
   profile: np.histogram called once PER FEATURE; pure-Python edge setup
            (linspace, _get_bin_edges) rebuilt every call
DistanceRepresentation.transform  : 11 ms/call  -> scipy cdist (C), do NOT touch
PredictionRepresentation.transform:  0.03 ms/call -> trivial, do NOT touch
KDERepresentation                 : sklearn KernelDensity (C), do NOT touch
```

Histogram scales linearly with feature count because each feature triggers a
separate (partly pure-Python) `np.histogram`. Negligible for 1 feature
(DyS/HDy on a score column); real for wide `HDx`/`GHDx`. **Conditional target.**

---

## 3. Where to put Cython (the map)

| Place | Module | Kernel | Priority | Expected gain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Histogram DM α-sweep | `matching/_histogram.py` (DyS, HDy, HDx) | `match_sweep` | **P1** | ~5–20× on the matching inner loop |
| Inline distances | `metrics/_distances.py` consumers | `_distances.pxd` (cdef inline) | **P1** | enables P1; removes call overhead |
| Batched histograms | `representations/_histogram.py` | `histogram_batch` | P3 (wide HDx only) | several × for many features |
| Energy / SORD terms | `matching/_score.py`, `losses` | — | P3, **only if profiled** | TBD |
| Everything else | KDE, Distance, KernelMean, Prediction, solvers-multiclass, sampling | — | skip | already C / too cheap |

> **Fit, protocols and grid search** were profiled separately: their best wins are
> **numpy vectorisation and caching, not Cython** (fit is classifier-bound). See §9.

---

## 4. Data structures & algorithms in C

The efficiency comes from the **memory layout and the loop structure**, not from
"using Cython" per se. Principles applied to every kernel:

- **Contiguous typed memoryviews.** Pass `const floating[::1]` (1-D) and
  `const floating[:, ::1]` (2-D, C-order). Coerce once at the Python boundary with
  `np.ascontiguousarray(x, dtype=...)`. Contiguity lets the C compiler auto-vectorise
  the inner loop and keeps it cache-friendly.
- **Fused types.** `ctypedef fused floating: float, double` → one kernel serves
  `float32` and `float64`; no code duplication, no hidden upcasts.
- **Zero allocation in the hot loop.** Preallocate one scratch buffer for the
  mixture and reuse it across the whole sweep. (Today the Python path allocates a
  fresh mixture + two normalised arrays *per α* — thousands of allocations/predict.)
- **`nogil` leaf loops.** The arithmetic loop holds no Python objects, so mark it
  `noexcept nogil`. Frees the GIL and leaves the door open to `prange`.
- **Struct-of-arrays.** Store the per-class histograms as one C-contiguous
  `(n_classes, n_bins)` block, not a Python list of arrays — one cache line stream.
- **Precompute invariants at fit, not per predict.** Fixed bin edges, and
  `sqrt(test)` / class-histogram square-roots for Hellinger, are computed once and
  stored contiguously.

### 4.1 Kernel A — histogram distribution-matching sweep (P1)

The whole `mixture → normalise → distance → argmin-over-α` collapses into one C
function. Because Hellinger/Topsøe-vs-α is **unimodal**, replace the 100-point
Python grid with an in-C **ternary (golden-section) search**: O(log(1/tol)·n_bins)
instead of O(grid·n_bins), and *zero* Python solver overhead.

Data structures:
- `const floating[::1] pos, neg, test` — one bin group, already normalised (n_bins).
- one reusable `floating[::1] mix` scratch buffer (n_bins).
- a function pointer / enum selecting the distance (so one kernel serves all
  Hellinger/Topsøe/prob-symm).

```cython
# matching/_matching_fast.pyx
# cython: language_level=3, boundscheck=False, wraparound=False, cdivision=True
from libc.math cimport sqrt, fabs
cimport cython

ctypedef fused floating:
    float
    double

cdef inline double _hellinger(const floating[::1] m, const floating[::1] q,
                              Py_ssize_t n) noexcept nogil:
    cdef double s = 0.0, d
    cdef Py_ssize_t i
    for i in range(n):
        d = sqrt(m[i]) - sqrt(q[i])
        s += d * d
    return sqrt(0.5 * s)

cdef double _dist_at_alpha(double a, const floating[::1] pos,
                           const floating[::1] neg, const floating[::1] test,
                           floating[::1] mix, int metric) noexcept nogil:
    cdef Py_ssize_t i, n = pos.shape[0]
    cdef double total = 0.0
    for i in range(n):                       # mixture, no allocation
        mix[i] = a * pos[i] + (1.0 - a) * neg[i]
        total += mix[i]
    if total > 0:                            # normalise in place
        for i in range(n):
            mix[i] /= total
    # metric==0 -> hellinger, 1 -> topsoe, ...  (branch hoisted out for speed)
    return _hellinger(mix, test, n)

def match_sweep(floating[::1] pos, floating[::1] neg, floating[::1] test,
                int metric=0, double tol=1e-5):
    """Return the alpha in [0,1] minimising distance(mix(alpha), test)."""
    cdef floating[::1] mix = pos.copy()      # one scratch buffer
    cdef double lo = 0.0, hi = 1.0, m1, m2, f1, f2
    with nogil:
        while hi - lo > tol:                 # ternary search, all in C
            m1 = lo + (hi - lo) / 3.0
            m2 = hi - (hi - lo) / 3.0
            f1 = _dist_at_alpha(m1, pos, neg, test, mix, metric)
            f2 = _dist_at_alpha(m2, pos, neg, test, mix, metric)
            if f1 < f2: hi = m2
            else:       lo = m1
    return 0.5 * (lo + hi)
```

The multi-bin sweep (11 bin sizes) stays a thin Python loop calling `match_sweep`
per bin size, then takes the median — 11 C calls/predict instead of ~1,100 ×
4 numpy calls.

### 4.2 Kernel B — batched histograms (P3, wide HDx only)

Replace N pure-Python `np.histogram` calls (each recomputing edges) with one
fused pass. Fixed-width bins make the bin index a single division — no edge array
lookup, no `searchsorted`.

Data structure: counts as a flat C buffer `out[f*n_bins + b]` (struct-of-arrays
over features), filled in one `nogil` double loop, normalised after.

```cython
# representations/_histogram_fast.pyx
@cython.boundscheck(False)
@cython.wraparound(False)
def histogram_batch(const double[:, ::1] X, int n_bins,
                    double lo, double hi):
    """Per-feature fixed-width histograms in one pass -> (n_features, n_bins)."""
    cdef Py_ssize_t n = X.shape[0], nf = X.shape[1], i, f, b
    cdef double width = (hi - lo) / n_bins, v
    cdef double[:, ::1] out = np.zeros((nf, n_bins))
    with nogil:
        for i in range(n):
            for f in range(nf):
                v = (X[i, f] - lo) / width            # bin index by division
                b = <Py_ssize_t> v
                if b < 0: b = 0
                elif b >= n_bins: b = n_bins - 1
                out[f, b] += 1.0
    return np.asarray(out)                              # normalise in caller
```

Note the loop order `(samples, features)` reads `X` row-major (C-contiguous) →
cache-friendly. Edges are implicit (`lo + b*width`), computed zero times.

### 4.3 Shared inline distances (`.pxd`)

Put the `cdef inline` distance functions in a header so several `.pyx` files
`cimport` them and the compiler **inlines** them (no call overhead at all):

```cython
# _cython/_distances.pxd
ctypedef fused floating:
    float
    double
cdef inline double hellinger(const floating[::1] p, const floating[::1] q) noexcept nogil
cdef inline double topsoe(const floating[::1] p, const floating[::1] q)    noexcept nogil
cdef inline double probsymm(const floating[::1] p, const floating[::1] q)  noexcept nogil
```

## 5. Build & packaging infrastructure (sklearn-style)

Today: bare `setup.py`, pure Python. Add:

```
pyproject.toml      # PEP 517 build deps
setup.py            # cythonize() Extensions
MANIFEST.in         # ship *.pyx, *.pxd in sdist
.gitignore          # ignore generated *.c, *.so, *.pyd
```

`pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=64", "Cython>=3.0", "numpy>=2.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

`setup.py` additions:
```python
from setuptools import Extension
from Cython.Build import cythonize
import numpy as np

DIRECTIVES = {"language_level": "3", "boundscheck": False,
              "wraparound": False, "cdivision": True}
EXTENSIONS = [
    Extension("mlquantify.matching._matching_fast",
              ["mlquantify/matching/_matching_fast.pyx"],
              include_dirs=[np.get_include()]),
]
# setup(..., ext_modules=cythonize(EXTENSIONS, compiler_directives=DIRECTIVES))
```

**Compiler policy (recommended): optional acceleration + pure-Python fallback +
prebuilt wheels.** Unlike sklearn (hard compile requirement), keep a fallback so a
source install without a compiler still works, and ship binary wheels so 99% of
users get the compiled path transparently:

```python
# matching/_histogram.py
try:
    from ._matching_fast import match_sweep            # compiled
except ImportError:                                    # pragma: no cover
    from ._matching_py import match_sweep              # pure-Python reference
```

CI: add **cibuildwheel** (Linux/macOS/Windows × supported Pythons) to the release
workflow; build + test the compiled path on every PR.

---

## 6. File & naming conventions

```
mlquantify/
  _cython/
    __init__.py
    _distances.pxd            # shared cdef inline distances
  matching/
    _histogram.py             # DyS/HDy/HDx — call the kernel (with fallback import)
    _matching_fast.pyx        # Kernel A
    _matching_py.py           # pure-Python reference twin
  representations/
    _histogram.py
    _histogram_fast.pyx       # Kernel B (P3)
    _histogram_py.py
benchmarks/                   # asv + quick scripts
tests/test_cython_parity.py   # compiled == python
```

- Compiled module: leading underscore, `_<name>_fast.pyx`, beside its `.py` user.
- Every `.pyx` opens with the `# cython:` directive comment.
- Every kernel has a `_<name>_py.py` twin with an identical signature.

---

## 7. Efficiency tests & benchmarks (proving it changed)

### 7.1 Correctness parity — `tests/test_cython_parity.py`
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("n_bins", [8, 16, 64])
def test_match_sweep_parity(n_bins):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    pos, neg, test = (rng.random(n_bins) for _ in range(3))
    a_fast = match_sweep(pos/pos.sum(), neg/neg.sum(), test/test.sum())
    a_py   = match_sweep_py(pos/pos.sum(), neg/neg.sum(), test/test.sum())
    assert abs(a_fast - a_py) < 1e-4
```

### 7.2 Guard — fail loudly if the extension isn't built
```python
def test_cython_extension_built():
    import importlib
    importlib.import_module("mlquantify.matching._matching_fast")
```

### 7.3 Benchmarks — two tiers
- **Quick/local** `benchmarks/bench_matching.py` (`time.perf_counter`): prints a
  Python-vs-Cython table across sizes + the speedup factor. This is what you run
  to *see* the change:
  ```
  workload          python   cython   speedup
  HDy predict 1k     0.040    0.006     6.7x
  HDy predict 10k    0.39     0.052     7.5x
  HDx 100feat 1k     7.3 ms   1.1 ms    6.6x
  ```
- **Rigorous/tracked** `asv` (airspeed velocity — what numpy/sklearn use):
  `asv.conf.json` + `benchmarks/` with `time_*` methods; `asv continuous main HEAD`
  reports the %-change and **flags regressions**. This is the durable answer to
  "did efficiency really change?" and the only thing suitable for CI gating
  (raw timings are too noisy to assert directly).

### 7.4 Baseline protocol (Phase 0)
Before any Cython, capture cProfile + asv numbers for: `DyS`/`HDy` predict,
wide-`HDx` predict, `EDy`, `EMQ`, on a fixed dataset and seed. These are the
"before" numbers every later PR is measured against.

---

## 8. Phased rollout

- **Phase 0 — baseline.** Add `benchmarks/` (quick script + asv) and record
  numbers against today's pure-Python code. No Cython yet.
- **Phase 1 — infra.** `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` extensions, MANIFEST, gitignore,
  one trivial `.pyx`, the fallback-import pattern, and `cibuildwheel` in CI — prove
  the build/ship pipeline end to end.
- **Phase 2 — Kernel A.** `match_sweep` + `_distances.pxd` + pure-Python twin +
  parity test + benchmark delta, wired into DyS/HDy/HDx.
- **Phase 3 — conditional.** Kernel B (batched histograms) *iff* a wide-`HDx`
  benchmark justifies it; profile SORD/energy and decide.
- **Phase 4 — wheels.** Publish binary wheels for the supported matrix.

Each phase is independently shippable and leaves the library installable and green.

---

## 9. Adjacent optimisations (fit / protocols / grid search)

Profiling these paths shows the best wins are **numpy vectorisation and
algorithmic caching, not Cython** — the heavy work is already in sklearn/scipy C.

### 9.1 Threshold-method evaluation — vectorise `evaluate_thresholds` (no compiler)
`counting/_utils.py:evaluate_thresholds` is a Python loop over thresholds, each
doing an O(n) `np.where` + count → **O(n_thresholds · n_samples)**. Measured:

```
score_edges="auto" (unique scores):  n=500 -> 12.9 ms   n=2000 -> 77 ms   n=8000 -> 671 ms   (quadratic!)
score_edges="fixed" (101 thresholds): n=500 ->  2.6 ms   n=2000 -> 4.4 ms   n=8000 ->  10 ms
```

The `"auto"` path is quadratic. Fix by computing TP/FP at all thresholds from
**sorted scores via cumulative sums** (the `roc_curve` trick): O(n log n), one pass,
pure numpy. Speeds every threshold method (TAC/TX/TMAX/T50/MS/MS2) and removes the
cliff. Cython unnecessary.

### 9.2 Median Sweep `_adjust` — vectorise the threshold loop
`MS`/`MS2` loop over *every* threshold calling `CC(threshold=thr).aggregate(...)`,
re-counting each time. The adjusted count at all thresholds is the same cumulative
computation as §9.1 — fold them together and take the median over a precomputed
array instead of a Python loop.

### 9.3 GridSearchQ — precompute protocol batches (DONE) + classifier cache (deferred)
**Shipped (exact, safe):** the seeded protocol yields identical samples for every
combination, yet the original regenerated it (and recomputed the ground-truth
prevalences) `|grid|` times — and protocol generation costs about as much as a
classifier fit. `GridSearchQ.fit` now materialises the batches + true prevalences
**once**, giving **~1.48x** on a 6-combination DyS search with byte-identical
`best_params_`/`best_score` (verified against the per-combination loop across
app/npp/upp protocols). Predict-time cost also benefits transitively from
Kernel A (§4.1).

**Deferred (bigger, needs a core change):** reusing the classifier / CV predictions
across combinations that share the estimator would save the repeated `fit`, but the
existing `estimator_fitted=True` path uses *in-sample* predictions whereas the
default builds the representation from *out-of-fold CV* predictions — so a naive
cache would silently change model selection. Doing it exactly requires an additive
"inject precomputed CV predictions" hook in the aggregative `fit`; left as a
separate, carefully-tested change.

### 9.4 Protocol index generation — minor caching
`get_indexes_with_prevalence` recomputes the per-class pools (`np.where(y==c)`) every
call; `APP.split` for 210 batches measured ~43 ms total (~0.2 ms/batch), dwarfed by
the per-batch `predict`. Precompute the per-class pools once only if it ever matters.

### 9.5 Not worth touching
`fit` is **classifier-bound** — a TX fit at n=8000 spent ~0.037 s of 0.052 s inside
sklearn's `LogisticRegression.fit`/CV (C); the mlquantify orchestration around it is
negligible. KDE, `cdist`, `pairwise_kernels`, simplex sampling are already C.

---

## 10. Open decisions

1. **Compiler policy:** optional-accel + fallback + wheels *(recommended)* vs hard
   compile requirement (sklearn-style).
2. **Build backend:** setuptools + Cython *(simpler, recommended)* vs meson-python
   (newer sklearn; more powerful, steeper).
3. **Benchmark tooling:** asv + quick script *(recommended)* vs quick script only.
4. **Precision:** ship `float64` only first, or fused `float32/float64` from day one.
5. **First PR scope:** Phase 0+1 together (infra + baseline) before any kernel.
