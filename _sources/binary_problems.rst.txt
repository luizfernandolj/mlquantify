Binary problems
===============

All methods in the library work with binary problems. A binary problem is a classification problem where the target variable has only two possible values (e.g., 0 and 1, or "yes" and "no"). In this context, the library provides tools for quantifying the class distribution of the target variable in a given dataset. The usage of the library for binary problems is similar to that for multiclass problems, with the main difference being the number of classes involved and the funcionality of some quantifiers.
